This is my personal react-redux starter kit :-)

## Installation

npm install webpack -g

npm install webpack-dev-server -g

npm install

## Npm tasks

dev server :

npm run dev

build project :

npm run build

Unit tests:

npm run test

Check css and js by lint :

npm run lint

Run pre-commit lint:

npm run lint:staged

## TODOO

- webpack dev config and webpack prod config

- runing  webpack from .sh (windows -.bat) file - unnecessary global webpack package

- action creators in redux flow

- Minification

- tests, tests and tests
